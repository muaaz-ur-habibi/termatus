<h3>What❓</h3>
A system information and status viewer, similiar to those you see in the H4CK3R movies. Except this isnt all green on black with random matrix rain. It actually shows some useful information
<hr>
<h3>Why❓</h3>
I recently had discovered about the amazing Rich library, and was looking for things to make with it. And I just so happened to stumble across bpytop, which was mind-blowing. I know mine does'nt come as close, but I really think for a first project it turned out nice
<hr>
<h3>Cool. What does it show?📈❓</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your basic PC information (OS, System, all that)</li>
  <li>Your CPU information (model, cores, etc.)</li>
  <li>Your CPU stats (used (%), speeds, time)</li>
  <li>The current running processes, although not all of it, only 6 to 7</li>
  <li>Your internet information (IP address, your current location etc.)</li>
  <li>Your internet stats (bytes, packets, loss)</li>
  <li>Your memory a.k.a disks information (names, mount points)</li>
  <li>Your disks' memory stats</li>
  <li>Your RAM stats (used, available)</li>
</ul>

<h3>OK, so what's special about mine❓</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Well, unlike bpytop which only works on Linux, mine can actually work on Windows as well 😎. But mine still is very very lacking in UI/UX😅<br></li>
  <li>I also am a weeb, so you know...</li>
  <li>Mine is also more 'vibrant' I guess</li>
</ol>
