<h2>What❓</h2>
A system information and status viewer, similiar to those you see in the H4CK3R movies. Except this isnt all green on black with random matrix rain

<h2>Why❓</h2>
I recently had discovered about the amazing Rich library, and was looking for things to make with it. And I just so happened to stumble across bpytop, which was mind-blowing. I know mine does'nt come as close, but I really think for a first project it turned out nice
